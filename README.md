# Conversion and Roll-Out Metrics for PT Bike Service

Here you find the SQL queries to update the [Sercice Dashboard in Excel](https://jobrad.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/jr-fch-ext-service/Freigegebene%20Dokumente/Bike%20Service%20x%20PIA%20MIA/02%20PIA/Servicedashboard_BikeService.xlsx?d=w7cd019a125fc4ee382e348235ba6fc00&csf=1&web=1&e=dgtLfj).

The files `dataset_conversion_bs1zero.sql` and `dataset_conversion_bs2zero.sql` contain the queries for the old (`[...]1zero.sql`) and the new (`[...]2zero.sql`) service world. Both queries offer a dataset to add to the dashboard. The conversion rates are calculated in the dashboard itself.
